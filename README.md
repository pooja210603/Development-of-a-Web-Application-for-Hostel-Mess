# Development of a Web Application for Hostel Mess
There is a need for students with food allergies to be aware of the ingredients and allergens used in campus canteen meals, and also for international students to get comfortable with the local cuisine. Additionally, students living in the hostels need to have access to the mess menu to make decisions about their meals, particularly in case of food allergies. However, there exists a communication gap between the mess committee and the students. To address these issues, this Django-based web application has been developed to enable students to review the menu and provide their valuable suggestions for improvement. The feedback mechanism allows the administrator to monitor and respond to user feedback for continuous improvement of the application. This app enables college students to rate and review the quality of food, service, and hygiene in their mess. Moreover, students can suggest improvements and report any problems they face. The work aims to help students make informed food choices and also provide a platform for mess administrators to understand and address the concerns of their consumers. This application also assists parents of hostel-residing students to keep track of the menu, provide recommendations, and offer feedback on the nutrition and quality of meals provided in the mess.
